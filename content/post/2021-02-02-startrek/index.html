<p>It was only a matter of time before I reached <a href="https://twitter.com/kearneymw/status/1354640480127111174">‚ÄúThe Sopranos Point‚Äù</a> of the pandemic and decided to pick up Star Trek. I thought I might not ~get it~ but turns out that it‚Äôs just a soap opera for nerds (üôã)‚Ä¶ so it was also only a matter of time before I decided to analyze data from it. I posted <a href="https://twitter.com/sharlagelfand/status/1354881416480358409">a plot on twitter</a> (only click if you want spoilers!), but left the code a mystery (ok no one asked for it). Here it is now!</p>
<p>At the time I embarked on this little project, we had just wrapped up season 1 of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Now we‚Äôre on season 3, but‚Ä¶.. let‚Äôs just look at Season 1 here.</p>
<p>The way that the characters speak is so wonderful and distinct, and I wanted to see if text analysis could capture that. Luckily, I didn‚Äôt have to work very hard, neither to get the data nor to analyze it, thanks to wonderful packages like <a href="https://leonawicz.github.io/rtrek/index.html">{rtrek}</a>, which contains datasets related to Star Trek - including transcripts! And, of course, where would I be without <a href="https://juliasilge.github.io/tidytext/">{tidytext}</a> for text analysis?</p>
<p>First, I‚Äôll grab the TNG transcripts via {rtrek} and filter only for the first season:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(rtrek)
library(dplyr)

transcripts &lt;- st_transcripts() %&gt;%

<p>We can see already that the characters need some ~data cleaning~ (and thanks to the helpful <a href="https://leonawicz.github.io/rtrek/articles/ex-episode-analysis.html">{rtrek} vignette</a> I knew this would be coming). ‚ÄúPicard V.o.‚Äù is a voiceover by Jean-Luc Picard, the Captain of this series‚Äô ship, The Enterprise. It may be a voiceover, but it‚Äôs just Picard nonetheless.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll strip off that excess " V.o." text, and some other variants that I found from peeking at the values of <code>character</code>. Then, we just see ‚ÄúPicard‚Äù:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(stringr)

<p>My plan is to look at ‚Äúcatchphrases‚Äù for each major character in season 1, starting with bigrams - two words appearing together. If you look at the previous sentence, the bigrams are ‚Äúmy plan‚Äù, ‚Äúplan is‚Äù, ‚Äúis to‚Äù, ‚Äúto look‚Äù, etc etc.</p>
<p>From already posting this on twitter and getting roasted for it, I know that two main character‚Äôs names will be interpreted as multiple words (because, I guess, they are): La Forge, of Geordi La Forge, and Jean-Luc, of the previously mentioned Picard. ‚ÄúLa‚Äù is not meaningful without ‚ÄúForge‚Äù, and ‚ÄúJean‚Äù not without ‚ÄúLuc‚Äù, so I‚Äôm going to cheat a bit here and glue those together for the analysis:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>transcripts &lt;- transcripts %&gt;%
  mutate(
    line = str_replace_all(line, &quot;La Forge&quot;, &quot;LaForge&quot;),
    line = str_replace_all(line, &quot;Jean-Luc&quot;, &quot;JeanLuc&quot;)
  )</code></pre>
<p>Ok ok, I‚Äôm getting ahead of myself. Let‚Äôs focus on the characters I care about: Picard (the captain), Data (Android :3), Riker (Commander), Beverly (the ship‚Äôs doctor), Tasha (head of security - spoiler, but RIP), Geordi (??? he becomes Chief Engineer in season 1 but I forget his job before), Troi (the ship‚Äôs counselor), Worf (a Klingon commander?), and Wesley (a literal child but ok). No offense to everyone else, no offense to Q. Nine characters fit on a single plot really well!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>transcripts &lt;- transcripts %&gt;%
  filter(character %in% c(
    &quot;Picard&quot;, &quot;Data&quot;, &quot;Riker&quot;, &quot;Beverly&quot;,
    &quot;Tasha&quot;, &quot;Geordi&quot;, &quot;Troi&quot;, &quot;Worf&quot;, &quot;Wesley&quot;
  ))</code></pre>
<p>Now, I‚Äôll split every line into bigrams and count how many times the bigrams appear, by character:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidytext)

bigrams &lt;- transcripts %&gt;%
  unnest_tokens(output = bigram, input = line, token = &quot;ngrams&quot;, n = 2) %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(bigram)) %&gt;%
  count(character, bigram, sort = TRUE)

bigrams</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 50,958 x 3
##    character bigram            n
##    &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;int&gt;
##  1 Picard    number one      138
##  2 Picard    this is          94
##  3 Picard    of the           86
##  4 Data      it is            67
##  5 Picard    to the           66
##  6 Picard    we are           56
##  7 Picard    in the           54
##  8 Picard    captain&#39;s log    53
##  9 Picard    on the           52
## 10 Picard    do you           49
## # ‚Ä¶ with 50,948 more rows</code></pre>
<p>Amazingly enough, the top bigram is actually meaningful - ‚Äúnumber one‚Äù, by Picard, refers to the ship‚Äôs commander, William Riker. But most of the rest of the top 10 bigrams are pretty boring - ‚Äúthis is‚Äù, ‚Äúof the‚Äù, ‚Äúit is‚Äù, ‚Äúto the‚Äù. Some of these bigrams consist of two stopwords together.</p>
<p>Stopwords do not add much meaning to a sentence, and we can usually safely remove them. Since we have bigrams, two words together, here, it‚Äôs not a matter of just anti-joining on a stopwords data set. Instead, I‚Äôll take the approach of removing a bigram if <em>both</em> of the words are stopwords.</p>
<p>From the {tidytext} package, I‚Äôm using the ‚Äúsnowball‚Äù stopword lexicon - this will allow for more conservative stopword removal, since it contains way less words than the other two lexicons:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>stop_words %&gt;%
  count(lexicon)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 3 x 2
##   lexicon      n
##   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;int&gt;
## 1 onix       404
## 2 SMART      571
## 3 snowball   174</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>tng_stopwords &lt;- stop_words %&gt;%
  filter(lexicon == &quot;snowball&quot;) %&gt;%
  pull(word)</code></pre>
<p>To see if <em>both</em> words in a bigram are stopwords, I‚Äôll split the bigram into two columns, and test if each is a stopword (yes I know how to use <code>across()</code> wowww):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bigrams &lt;- bigrams %&gt;%
  separate(bigram, into = c(&quot;word1&quot;, &quot;word2&quot;), sep = &quot; &quot;) %&gt;%
  mutate(across(c(word1, word2), .fns = list(is_stopword = ~ .x %in% tng_stopwords)))

<p>We could just look at each character‚Äôs top bigrams, but I want to see what makes them <em>them</em>; what makes them unique - what if all of the characters have the same top bigrams? Boring!</p>
<p>Because I‚Äôm only human, I‚Äôll go ahead and just copy Julia Silge‚Äôs excellent <a href="https://juliasilge.com/blog/introducing-tidylo/">blog post on {tidylo}</a> and use weighted log odds, a method of comparing features (bigrams) across some set (characters).</p>
<p>Since this is ~tidy text mining~, it‚Äôs super easy to get the top 5 bigrams for each character, by the weighted log odds (no I don‚Äôt know what it is but it compares them, OK? I‚Äôll remove the x-axis labels anyways)</p>

<p>Now, finally, we can visualize. Of course, there‚Äôs R packages for making visualizations look Star Trek-y. In particular, I‚Äôm using <a href="https://leonawicz.github.io/trekcolors/index.html">{trekcolors}</a> and <a href="https://leonawicz.github.io/trekfont/">{trekfont}</a> to supply the‚Ä¶ colours and font. By the way, all of these Star Trek packages were created by <a href="https://twitter.com/NeverBruncher">Matt Leonawicz</a>. Thank you for the packages!</p>

<p>I absolutely love how much the different character‚Äôs personalities (and yes, catchphrases!) shine through, even in such a simple analysis like this. Jean-Luc Picard starts every episode in season 1 with the Captain‚Äôs log, and often calls Riker ‚ÄúNumber one‚Äù. Data is an Android who cannot use compound words, and is a wealth of, well, data - ‚Äúmost interesting‚Äù and ‚Äúit appears‚Äù make total sense. Deanna Troi, the counselor, focuses on understanding people and other life forms‚Äô feelings - ‚ÄúI sense‚Äù and ‚ÄúI believe‚Äù are so appropriate. And it goes on!</p>
<p>Of course, as folks on twitter quickly realized (and I knew too, okay!), some of these are in fact trigrams (three words together), not bigrams. Captain Picard starts every episode with ‚ÄúCaptain‚Äôs log, stardate‚Ä¶‚Äù and then the date. So it‚Äôs of no surprise that ‚ÄúCaptain‚Äôs log‚Äù and ‚Äúlog stardate‚Äù would both appear. Would it be more accurate to look at trigrams? ‚Ä¶quadgrams? What else are we missing? OH WELL.</p>
<p>If anyone knows of some way to look at multiple n-grams (e.g.¬†bigrams, trigrams, ‚Ä¶quadgrams?) all together, and exclude any overlap (like, keeping ‚Äúcaptain‚Äôs log stardate‚Äù but not ‚Äúcaptain‚Äôs log‚Äù), <a href="https://www.yearoftrek.com/2019/03/the-battle.html">I‚Äôm all ears</a>. I did try some stuff out but it felt too much like sketchy science to include here!</p>
<p>I could go on and on (maybe I have already) but I‚Äôd rather go watch more Star Trek. Bye!</p>
